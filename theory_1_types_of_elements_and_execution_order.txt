Here come JMETER Test Plan elements and their base order of execution.

Test Plan - is a workspace for what follows next, has useful options for configuring Thread Groups
    Thread Group -  contains a number of things doing something in parallel e.g. Users/Samplers
        Config Elements - provide configuration and helper elements e.g. HTTP Cookie Manager/HTTP Header Manager
        Pre-processors - allow to change requests before we fire them
        Timer - adds wait time
        Logic Controller/Sampler
            Logic Controller - controls flow very much like in programming languages with if, for, while, ...
            Sampler -  sampler does the work e.g. sends HTTP request, JDBC request, ...
        Post-processors - can analyze response of the request
        Assertions - verify results
        Listener - allow to visualize/summarize results

This order of execution is enforced even if you place those elements in JMETER not according to the order.
